It is evening; the sun is setting, and the shepherd, who tends the
flocks of little Mary's Papa, is, with his good little dog, driving the
sheep to the fold, where they will rest in safety. That is his cottage
which stands on the other side of the road.

        The tongs stood in the room where Mary oft staid,
        And the lantern gave light to the hall where she play'd.

       *       *       *       *       *

        The table was placed in the corner quite snug,
        And the milk for her breakfast was put in the jug.

If you look on the other side of the leaf, you will see the picture of
the park that little Mary one day passed through, where she first saw
the deer.

Should you not have liked to have been with her, and jumped and played
on the lawn, and in the shrubberies.

        When little Mary was cold, 'twas Mamma's desire,
        That in this pretty stove should be made a nice fire.

        This bottle you see,
          Holding water quite clear,
        Is to wash Mary's hands,
          Till they cleanly appear.

        In little Mary's room were placed near at hand,
        This elegant snuffers, and sweet pretty stand.

       *       *       *       *       *

        These plates you admire for being so neat,
        Held little Mary's pudding, her pie, or her meat.

This is the rose that hid the thorn that pricked little Mary's finger.

Little Mary was eating her breakfast when she saw a Robin red-breast
standing on a rail, at a little distance; she gathered up the crumbs as
fast as she could, and threw them out of the window upon the gravel
walk. As soon as the bird observed the bread, he jumped down off the
rail, and began picking up the crumbs: but Mary, eager to shew her love
to her little visitor, threw out more crumbs, which frightened it
away.

This is the Crocus that grew in little Mary's garden by the side of the
snow-drop and primrose.

A traveller and his little dog, one day, wanted to get to the other side
of a river; but the man was so very poor he could not find money
enough to pay the boatman for taking him over. Little Mary, who was
always very good, seeing his distress, gave him all the money she had in
her pocket, wished him a safe journey, and went home with a light
heart, having done a good action.
